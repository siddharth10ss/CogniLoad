## 🚨 The Problem: Burnout
Traditional to-do lists are **infinite**. They don't care if you're tired, stressed, or overloaded. They just ask for *more*.  
For students and developers, this leads to a cycle of overcommitment and inevitable burnout.

## 🌱 The Solution: CogniLoad
**CogniLoad** is a "Cognitive Weather Forecast" for your brain. It doesn't just list tasks; it calculates the **mental weight** of your schedule and warns you when you're approaching a cognitive crash.

It’s built to help you **do less, but better.**

## ✨ Key Features (The "Wow" Moments)

### 1. 🌡️ Cognitive Load Score
Visualizes your mental bandwidth in real-time.
- **Unburdened (<100)**: Green, calm, spacious.
- **Moderate (100-250)**: Balanced focus.
- **Overload (>300)**: Visual warning signs (red shift, subtle shake).

### 2. 🧘 Zen Mode (Deep Focus)
A dedicated "Do Not Disturb" environment for executing a single task.
- **Brown Noise Generator**: Real-time audio synthesis to mask distractions.
- **Visual Breathing**: A subtle, rhythmic pulse to regulate anxiety.
- **Zero UI**: Hides everything except the timer and the task.

### 3. 🍃 Cognitive Offload (The Closure Ritual)
A special journaling space to "release" thoughts at the end of the day.
- **Micro-Journaling**: Limited to 280 characters to prevent rumination.
- **Mood Tagging**: One-tap emotional check-in.
- **"Let It Go"**: Entries vanish after submission, reinforcing the psychological act of release.

### 4. 🎨 Awwwards-Level Polish
- **Glassmorphism & Neomorphism**: Premium, modern UI.
- **Micro-Delights**: Staggered animations, magnetic hovering, and fluid transitions.
- **Atmospheric Soundscapes**: Custom web-audio implementation.
